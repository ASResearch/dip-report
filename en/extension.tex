\section{Future Work}

\subsection{Muli-dimension Voting}
\noindent
In Section~\ref{subsection:voting}, we take the number of invocations as the
criterion to determine DApps' ranking scores and show reasons why token
transfers involved in invocations are not taken into consideration. In the
future, we may introduce token transfers as another criterion for ranking DApps
when we can distinguish the causes of token transfer in more details by
analyzing the invocations to smart contract.

\subsection{Invocations Among DApps}
\noindent
Currently, DApps' ranks are determined by users' voting capacities (NR values),
which come from invocations of DApps. However, more complicated invocation
behaviors, such as invocations among DApps, can further transmit users' voting
capacities. So in our future work, we may compute each DApp's final ranking
score by giving each DApp an initial ranking score and running the Page Rank
algorithm~\cite{page1999pagerank}.
