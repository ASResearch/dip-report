\section{Proof}
\subsection{Proof of Property~\ref{p1}}
\label{subsection:proof1}
\begin{proof}
	Without loss of generality, we assume that the weights that voter $a_i$ values all DApps are $b_{i1}, b_{i2}, ..., b_{in}$ respectively, which are fixed. We assume that voter $a_i$'s contributory values to all DApps are $\nr_{i1},...,\nr_{in}$ respectively, which are adjustable by voter $a_i$.
	
	The optimization objective of voter $i$ is the weighted sum of ranking scores that he offers, defined by
	$$w_i = \sum_{j=1}^n b_{ij}\sqrt{\nr_{ij}}$$
	According to Cauthy's inequality it holds that
	$$w_i = \sum_{j=1}^n b_{ij}\sqrt{\nr_{ij}} \leq (\sum_{j=1}^n b_{ij}^2)(\sum_{j=1}^n \nr_{ij}) \leq (\sum_{j=1}^n b_{ij}^2)\nr_i$$
	The most right side of the formula	above is a fixed value. The equality holds if and only if
	$$\frac{b_{i1}^2}{\nr_{i1}}=\frac{b_{i2}^2}{\nr_{i2}}=\cdots=\frac{b_{in}^2}{\nr_{in}}$$
	So the property is proved.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Proof of Property~\ref{p2}}
\label{subsection:proof2}
\begin{proof}
	Without loss of generality, we assume that $d_1$'s developer splits $d_1$ into two DApps. For any normal voter who belongs to the second case in section~\ref{subsec:5.2}, that is, assume the weights that he values all DApps before splitting is $b_{i1},b_{i2},...,b_{in}$ and the weights that he values the two split DApps are $b'_{i1},b'_{i2}$, it holds that $b_{i1} \geq b'_{i1}+b'_{i2}$ according to our assumption.
	
	Then we compute the contributory values of voter $a_i$ before splitting. Define $H_i = \sum_{j=2}^n b_{ij}^2$, according to the conclusion in Property~\ref{p1} and Partition ratio theorem we have 
		 $$\frac{\nr_{i1}}{b_{i1}^2} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^n \nr_{ij}}{\sum_{j=1}^n b_{ij}^2} = \frac{\nr_i}{b_{i1}^2+H_i}$$
  Similarly, the contributory value of voter $a_i$ to the $t$-th split DApp (denote by $\nr'_{it},t=1,2$) is
  	 $$\nr'_{it} =  \frac{b_{it}^{'2}\nr_i}{b_{i1}^{'2}+b_{i2}^{'2}+H_i}$$
  	 Note that $b_{i1}^2 \geq (b‘_{i1}+b’_{i2})^2 >b_{i1}^{'2}+b_{i2}^{'2}$, we have
  	 $$\nr_{i1} > \nr'_{i1}+\nr'_{i2}$$
  	 So we give the constraint of contributory values for a rational enough voter. Generally, most voters belongs to the first case in Section~\ref{subsec:5.2}, that is, they simply distribute their voting capacities to split DApps. In either case, we have 
  	 	 	$$\nr_{i1} \geq \nr'_{i1}+\nr'_{i2}$$
  	 Define $S'_1,S'_2$ to be the two split DApps' ranking scores respectively. By definition 
  	 	 $$S'_1 =  \sum_{i=1}^m \sqrt{\nr'_{i1}},~~~S'_2 =  \sum_{i=1}^m \sqrt{\nr'_{i2}},~~~S_1 = \sum_{i=1}^m \sqrt{\nr_{i1}}$$
  	Define $U'_1$ to be the final reward of $d_1$'s developer after splitting. By definition 
  		 $$U'_1=\frac{S_1^{'2}+S_2^{'2}}{S_1^{'2}+S_2^{'2}+\sum_{j=2}^n S_j^2} \lambda M,~~~U_1=\frac{S^2_1}{S_1^2+\sum_{j=2}^n S_j^2} \lambda M$$
  	Note that given $S_2,...,S_n$, 
  		 $$ U_1 \geq U'_1 \Leftrightarrow S_1^2 \geq S_1^{'2}+S_2^{'2}$$
   In order to show whether splitting increases the utility, we only need to compare the following two terms
   	 $$S_1^2 = (\sum_{i=1}^m \sqrt{\nr_{i1}})^2,~~~S_1^{'2}+S_2^{'2}=  (\sum_{i=1}^m \sqrt{\nr'_{i1}})^2+(\sum_{i=1}^m \sqrt{\nr'_{i2}})^2$$
   	Actually, $S_1^2 \geq S_1^{'2}+S_2^{'2}$ can be proved according to the shortest distance theorem.

   		 	\input{../common/m2.tex}
   		 	\caption{Proof by shortest distance\label{fig:path}}
   		 \end{figure}
   As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:path}, we construct a grid whose length and width are divided into $m$ segments,  the $i$-th segment of which has length $\sqrt{\nr'_{i1}}$ and $\sqrt{\nr'_{i2}}$ respectively. 
   
   	Then, $S_1^{'2}+S_2^{'2}=A_0A_m^2$, that is, equals to the square of the blue segment's length. In the meanwhile, 
   	 $$S_1^2 = (\sum_{i=1}^m \sqrt{\nr_{i1}})^2 > (\sum_{i=1}^m \sqrt{\nr'_{i1}+\nr'_{i2}})^2 = (\sum_{i=1}^m A_{i-1}A_i)^2$$,
   	 which equals to the sum of squares of all red segments. Since the shortest distance between two points is a line-segment, it holds that $S_1^2 >S_1^{'2}+S_2^{'2}$.
   	 
   	 For the cases where $k>2$ DApps are split, 	we can regard it as successive splits and iteratively use the result on $k=2$. 
   	 
   	 So the property is proved.
   	 
\end{proof}

\subsection{Proof of Corollary~\ref{c1}}
\label{subsection:proof3}
\begin{proof}
	For any voter that is bought over by $d_1$'s developer, before splitting, we can regard the voter as a normal voter who values all DApps with weight vector $(1,0,0,...,0)$, as he gives his all voting capacity to $d_1$. Suppose now $d_1$ is split into $k$ DApps and the bough-over voter's contributory values to the $k$ DApps are $\nr_{t1},...,\nr_{tk}$, whose sum is fixed. According to the condition that the equality holds for Cauthy's inequality in the proof of Property~\ref{p1}, the voter can be regard as a normal voter who values all DApps with weight vector $(\sqrt{\nr_{t1}}/C,\sqrt{\nr_{t2}}/C,...,\sqrt{\nr_{tk}}/C,0,0,...,0)$, where $C=\sum_{j=1}^k \sqrt{\nr_{tj}}$. That is, the voter values the split DApps with weights according to kind of proportion and values all other DApps with 0 weights.~\footnote{Note that scaling all weights by a constant does not effect the results, since the total contributory value of the voter only depends on the proportions of weights to total weights}. Since
		$$\sum_{j=1}^k \sqrt{\nr_{tj}}/C =1$$
	so the case in this corollary can be reduced to the case about normal voters(Property~\ref{p2}). So the corollary is proved.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Proof of Property~\ref{p3}}
\begin{proof}
	We first consider the case that a voter splits his account into two sub-accounts. We fix the actions of other voters. Let $c$ to be the original account and $a,b$ to be the split sun-accounts, $S,S'$ to be the ranking score of the DApp that the voter plans to vote before and after splitting respectively, $U,U'$ to be the final reward of the developer of the Dapp that the voter plans to vote before and after splitting respectively. By definition, we have 
	$$S= \sqrt{\nr_c}+O,~~S'=\sqrt{\nr_a}+\sqrt{\nr_b}+O$$,
	where $O$ is the sum of contributory values by other voters, which is fixed. 
	
	By ~\ref{eq:sqrt_nr} it holds that $S < S'$. That is, the rank of the DApp does not increase. 
	
	In the meanwhile, by definition, 
	$$U = \frac{S}{S+P}\lambda M,~~U' = \frac{S'}{S'+P} \lambda M$$,
	where $P$ is the sum of squares of other DApp's ranking score, which is fixed. 
	
	Since $S < S'$ it holds that $U \leq U'$. That is the developer's final reward does not increase.
	
	For the cases where $k>2$ sub-accounts are split, we can regard it as successive splits and iteratively use the result on $k=2$.
