\section{Introduction}

Generally, developers develop applications on some application platforms (like
Windows\footnote{\url{https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows}},Linux\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux}},
macOS\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS}},
iOS\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS}},
Android\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android}} etc.), and
benefit from their applications in traditional software development industry.
The way to get the benefits varies for different developers, including but not
limited to salaries paid by software enterprises, revenue by selling the
applications or displaying advertises in their applications.

However, the enterprises who build the application platforms also get benefits
from the applications, while the benefits are not shared with the developers. 
Let's take operating system as an example here: an UI/UX designer wants to use \texttt{Sketch}, 
as we know that the application only works on \texttt{macOS} device, so besides
paying for the application itself, the designer needs to pay Apple\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.}} 
for the device in order to use the application. Obviously, Apple get benefits from such user, 
however, Apple will not share the benefits with the \texttt{Sketch} developers. 
Another similar example is that users have to pay Apple or
Microsoft\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft}} to use
AutoCAD\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD}}. In such cases,
the key factor of choosing a platform is whether the platform
supports the needed applications for users. In other words, high quality
applications are critical to the growth of an application platform. Thus, we
believe that application developers should be guaranteed to share the profits
of application platforms.

The same thing happens in the blockchain industry since the 
DApp (Decentralized Application) developers did not get benefits from the
platform. In 2004, Ethereum community proposed "Smart Contract", 
which extended blockchains' ability from peer-to-peer
cryptocurrency networks to decentralized application platforms. However, it is
quite similar between decentralized application development and traditional
application development. And decentralized application developers still benefit
nothing from a blockchain's increased value.


Generally speaking, the increased value of a blockchain comes from the new block
reward. We believe that a blockchain's value comes from users' data. Thus, the
new block reward should be distributed to all parties that contribute the
new data. DApp developers are key parts of the contributors, and they should
share the new block reward. However, Bitcoin and other blockchain systems
which use PoW (Proof of Work) consensus algorithm distribute the new block reward
to the miners, while PoS (proof of stake) blockchain systems distribute the new
block reward to the stake holders. While in the end, DApp developers got
nothing.

Conceptually, a DApp is a set of smart contracts with specific
functionality, while a smart contract is a computer protocol intended to
digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a
contract. Smart contracts allow the performance of credible transactions
without third
parties\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart\_contract}}.
Currently, most DApps use smart contracts as backend, and applications on PC,
mobile or web as frontend.

We believe that blockchain systems or DApp platforms, DApp developers and DApp
users are closely related with each other. First, DApp platforms provide
necessary facilities for DApp developers so that more and more DApp developers
can build their own DApps and benefit from the DApps. Second, DApp
developers build DApps for different scenarios, which bring more and more
users to the DApp platforms. Finally, DApp users produce onchain data,
increase liquidity, and increase the value of a blockchain system.

Notice that we mean DApp developers instead of Nebulas DApp developers or
blockchain system developers. Thus, we shall use developers short for DApp
developers without ambiguity. Also, a DApp developer may be a stake holder.
He/she may benefit from being a stake holder and that benefit is not considered
as sharing the increased value of blockchains.


It's inappropriate to directly distribute a platform's increased value to
corresponding application developers. First, the revenue is owned by
centralized organizations, like an enterprise, and application developers have
no chance to know the details or participate in sharing the revenue. Second, it
is difficult to quantify each developer's contribution to the growth of
application platforms. Fortunately, this situation can be changed in blockchain
industry since each invocation for smart contracts by each user is
publicly recorded on
blockchain. Thus, it is possible to \emph{reward or incentive each DApp developer by
quantifying each DApp's contribution}.

An ideal incentive mechanism should satisfy some basic properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item Justic:
\item Effectiveness:
\end{itemize}
